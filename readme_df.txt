You are asked to build the most accurate model you can to predict target column for data_test.csv. The metric to reflect accuracy can be defined by yourself. 

'id': id column for data_train, data_test, respectively
'num*': numerical features
'der*': derived features from other features
'cat*': categorical features
'target': target column, only exists in data_train. it is binary.

There are potentially missing values in each column.

The goal is to predict 'target' column for data_test.csv.

The solution should have a result csv file with two columns:
	1. 'id': the id column from data_test.csv
	2. 'target': the predicted probability of target being 1

The corresponding code to reproduce the result csv file should be included as well.
